// battleship game

// what am i trying to do?

// user gets to the website
// there's a rules page - welcome to 'simple battleship' , how to play: click the squares to guess where the battleship is , you'll know when you hit ;)

// when user hits, an icon of a bomb pops up in the space

// theres a reset button & a "back to the rules" page that takes you back to the first page
// if they click play, the game restarts again just like the first time
